                 visualize detailed morphologies for all major classes of
                 retinal neurons in the adult mouse. The analysis was performed
                 on retinas in which AP expression was activated by
                 Cre-mediated DNA recombination in a small fraction of cells.
                 Recombination was controlled pharmacologically and, to a first
                 approximation, appears to have occurred randomly. The
                 morphologies of 794 inner retinal neurons have been analyzed
                 by measuring arbor area, stratification level, and neurite
                 branching patterns. When analyzed in this multidimensional
                 parametric space, the cells can be clustered into subgroups by
                 visual inspection and by using the Ward's and K-means
                 algorithms. One application of this cell morphology data set
                 and cluster analysis is as a standard for comparison with the

                 viruses gained popularity as a method for labeling neural
                 circuits. The development of retrograde monosynaptic tracing
                 vectors has enabled visualization of the presynaptic sources

                 the first application of a novel viral tracer, based on
                 vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which directs retrograde

                 Indeed, visual space is not sampled uniformly across the
                 vertebrate retina. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density
                 increases and dendritic arbor size decreases toward retinal
                 locations with higher sampling frequency, such as the fovea in
                 primates and area centralis in carnivores [1]. In these
                 locations, higher acuity at the level of individual cells is
                 obtained because the receptive field center of a RGC
                 corresponds approximately to the spatial extent of its
                 dendritic arbor [2, 3]. For most species, structurally and
                 functionally distinct RGC types appear to have similar
                 topographies, collectively scaling their cell densities and
                 arbor sizes toward the same retinal location [4]. Thus, visual
                 space is represented across the retina in parallel by multiple
                 distinct circuits [5]. In contrast, we find a population of
                 mouse RGCs, known as alpha or alpha-like [6], that displays a
                 nasal-to-temporal gradient in cell density, size, and
                 receptive fields, which facilitates enhanced visual sampling
                 in frontal visual fields. The distribution of alpha-like RGCs
                 contrasts with other known mouse RGC types and suggests that,
                 unlike most mammals, RGC topographies in mice are arranged to
                 sample space differentially.",

              the presence or absence of the periphery effect. The

              and extended.2. The sustained/transient classification applied to
              both on-centre and off-centre cells.3. Lateral geniculate
              neurones may be similarly classified by the same tests.
              Occasional concentrically organized cells had a mixture of
              sustained and transient properties.4. A technique for
              simultaneous recording from a geniculate neurone and one or more
              retinal ganglion cells providing its excitatory input showed that
              the connexions were specific with respect to the

                 mouse retinal ganglion cells relate to the stratification
                 pattern of the dendrites of these neurons within the inner
                 plexiform layer. For this purpose, we used 14 morphological
                 measures to classify mouse retinal ganglion cells
                 parametrically into different clusters. Retinal ganglion cells
                 were labeled in one of three ways: Lucifer Yellow injection,
                 'DiOlistics' or transgenic expression of yellow fluorescent
                 protein. The resulting analysis of 182 cells revealed 10
                 clusters of monostratified cells, with dendrites confined to
                 either On or Off sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer, and
                 four clusters of bistratified cells, dendrites spanning the On
                 and Off sublaminae. We also sought to establish how these
                 parametrically identified retinal ganglion cell clusters
                 relate to cell types identified previously on the basis of
                 immunocytochemical staining and the expression of yellow
                 fluorescent protein. Cells labeled with an antibody against
                 melanopsin were found to be located within a single cluster,
                 while those labeled with the SMI-32 antibody were in four
                 different clusters. Yellow fluorescent protein expressing
                 cells were distributed within 13 of the 14 clusters identified
                 here, which demonstrates that yellow fluorescent protein
                 expression is a useful method for labeling virtually the
                 entire population of mouse retinal ganglion cells.
                 Collectively, these findings provide a valuable baseline for

  abstract    = "How specific features in the environment are represented
                 within the brain is an important unanswered question in
                 neuroscience. A subset of retinal neurons, called
                 direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), are specialized
                 for detecting motion along specific axes of the visual field.
                 Despite extensive study of the retinal circuitry that endows
                 DSGCs with their unique tuning properties, their downstream
                 circuitry in the brain and thus their contribution to visual
                 processing has remained unclear. In mice, several different
                 types of DSGCs connect to the dorsal lateral geniculate
                 nucleus (dLGN), the visual thalamic structure that harbours
                 cortical relay neurons. Whether direction-selective
                 information computed at the level of the retina is routed to
                 cortical circuits and integrated with other visual channels,
                 however, is unknown. Here we show that there is a di-synaptic
                 circuit linking DSGCs with the superficial layers of the
                 primary visual cortex (V1) by using viral trans-synaptic
                 circuit mapping and functional imaging of visually driven
                 calcium signals in thalamocortical axons. This circuit pools
                 information from several types of DSGCs, converges in a
                 specialized subdivision of the dLGN, and delivers
                 direction-tuned and orientation-tuned signals to superficial

                 Thus, the mouse harbours several functionally specialized,
                 parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways, one of which
                 originates with retinal DSGCs and delivers direction- and
                 orientation-tuned information specifically to the superficial
                 layers of the primary visual cortex. These data provide
                 evidence that direction and orientation selectivity of some V1
                 neurons may be influenced by the activation of DSGCs.",

                 documented, thus providing a basis of comparison for
                 developing ganglion cells. Alpha and beta ganglion cells in
                 cat retinae at various ages from birth (P0) to adult were
                 intracellularly injected with Lucifer yellow. At all ages,
                 both cell types strongly resembled their adult counterparts.
                 However, transient developmental characteristics established
                 their immaturity. These features included spiny protuberances
                 and ``rings'' along the dendritic surface that were no longer
                 detectable after 3 weeks of age. In a small proportion of both
                 inner and outer stratifying alpha ganglion cells, there was
                 aberrant dendritic arborization. However, by P5 there was no
                 remaining evidence of this deviant stratification pattern and
                 all alpha and beta cells displayed the adult pattern of
                 unistratification (present among the majority of these cells
                 from birth). For both alpha and beta cells, the area of
                 greatest development was the retinal periphery. In this region
                 alpha cell dendritic trees continued to grow until 3 weeks
                 postnatally, when they approached the adult dendritic field
                 size; around this time, the major period of beta cell
                 dendritic expansion began. From birth to adulthood, the
                 distance between alpha cell dendritic branching points
                 increased, while the number of nodes and tips decreased with
                 age. The temporal disparity between alpha and beta cell
                 dendritic expansion suggests that postnatal dendritic
                 development involves an active process of growth, rather than

                 single species of the southern hemisphere lamprey family
                 Geotriidae, Geotria australis, possesses the potential for
                 pentachromatic color discrimination opposed to the mono- or
                 dichromacy found in other lampreys. However, little is known
                 of the retinal ganglion cell types that contribute to visual
                 processing in G. australis. A quantitative morphological
                 approach was used to distinguish and describe retinal ganglion
                 cell types in G. australis. The morphology of retinal ganglion
                 cells was revealed by retrograde biocytin labeling from the
                 optic disc. Cells were digitally reconstructed, and somatic
                 area and position and dendritic field size, density,
                 tortuosity, and stratification were subjected to quantitative
                 morphometric analyses. Cluster analysis, in conjunction with
                 similarity profile analysis (SIMPROF), statistically
                 identified five discrete monostratified retinal ganglion cell
                 types, one of which may comprise two subtypes. Two
                 bistratified types were identified separately, including a
                 biplexiform and a bistratified subtype. The use of cluster
                 analysis with SIMPROF provided a robust statistical technique

                 were similar and significantly different from those of other

                 problems posed by ``lumpers vs. splitters'' when designating
                 cell types. The diversity of retinal ganglion cells suggests
                 that visual information in the lamprey G. australis is
                 processed in parallel streams, as in gnathostomes. These
                 findings, together with the results of previous studies,
                 indicate that the visual system of the lamprey G. australis

                 form functionally precise circuits remains largely unknown.
                 Here, we show that during development, the adhesion molecule
                 cadherin-6 (Cdh6) is expressed by a subset of retinal ganglion
                 cells (RGCs) and also by their targets in the brain. All of

                 Cdh3-RGCs which also express Cdh6 selectively innervate

                 system by comparing four transgenic mouse lines, each with a

                 moving in the opposite, ``null,'' direction. Historically,

                 is widely appreciated but only a tiny fraction of neuronal
                 diversity has been catalogued. Here we exploit recent progress
                 in genetic definition of cell types in an objective structural
                 approach to neuronal classification. The approach is based on
                 highly accurate quantification of dendritic arbor position
                 relative to neurites of other cells. We test the method on a
                 population of 363 mouse retinal ganglion cells. For each cell,
                 we determine the spatial distribution of the dendritic arbors,
                 or arbor density, with reference to arbors of an abundant,
                 well-defined interneuronal type. The arbor densities are
                 sorted into a number of clusters that is set by comparison
                 with several molecularly defined cell types. The algorithm
                 reproduces the genetic classes that are pure types, and
                 detects six newly clustered cell types that await genetic
                 definition.",

                 regarding its molecular and functional identity. The
                 identification of cell types from structure, a classic method,
                 relies on the time-consuming step of arbor tracing. However,
                 as genetic tools and imaging methods make data-driven
                 approaches to neuronal circuit analysis feasible, the need for
                 automated processing increases. Here, we first establish that
                 mouse retinal ganglion cell types can be as precise about
                 distributing their arbor volumes across the inner plexiform
                 layer as they are about distributing the skeletons of the
                 arbors. Then, we describe an automated approach to computing
                 the spatial distribution of the dendritic arbors, or arbor
                 density, with respect to a global depth coordinate based on
                 this observation. Our method involves three-dimensional
                 reconstruction of neuronal arbors by a supervised machine
                 learning algorithm, post-processing of the enhanced stacks to
                 remove somata and isolate the neuron of interest, and
                 registration of neurons to each other using automatically
                 detected arbors of the starburst amacrine interneurons as
                 fiducial markers. In principle, this method could be
                 generalizable to other structures of the CNS, provided that
                 they allow sparse labeling of the cells and contain a reliable

              peroxidase (HRP) into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus
              (LGNd) or optic tract. Ferret retina contains a number of types
              of retinal ganglion cells of which the relative cell body sizes,
              dendritic field structures, and central projections correspond
              closely to those of retinal ganglion cell types in the cat.
              Ferret retina contains about the same proportion of alphalike
              cells, a lower proportion of betalike cells, and thus a high
              proportion of other types of ganglion cells than cat retina.
              Ferret retina has a visual streak and somewhat weaker area
              centralis than cat retina. Changes in ganglion cell morphology
              associated with eccentricity are less pronounced in the ferret
              than in the cat. The adult ferret retina is about 12.5 mm in
              diameter, and the nasotemporal division is about 2.7 mm from the
              temporal margin. Interestingly, virtually all alpha cells in the
              pigmented ferrets studied projected contralaterally. Studies of
              infant ferrets indicate that 4 days after birth (P4) the area of
              ferret retina is 25\% that of the adult. The neonatal ferret
              retina contains numerous small, densely packed cells in the
              presumptive ganglion cell layer. At P4 these cells appear to be
              uniformly distributed across the retina. The area centralis and

                 prevalent across the retina, expressed by each of the five

                 selective gap junction connexins are deleted, the mouse has
                 recently become an important model for studying the function
                 of coupling between retinal neurons. In this study we examined
                 the tracer-coupling pattern of ganglion cells by injecting
                 them with the gap junction-permanent tracer Neurobiotin to
                 provide, for the first time, a comprehensive survey of
                 ganglion cell coupling in the wildtype mouse retina. Murine
                 ganglion cells were differentiated into 22 morphologically
                 distinct subtypes based on soma-dendritic parameters. Most
                 (16/22) ganglion cell subtypes were tracer-coupled to
                 neighboring ganglion and/or amacrine cells. The amacrine cells
                 coupled to ganglion cells displayed either polyaxonal or
                 wide-field morphologies with extensive arbors. We found that
                 different subtypes of ganglion cells were never coupled to one
                 another, indicating that they subserved independent electrical
                 networks. Finally, we found that the tracer-coupling patterns
                 of the 22 ganglion cell populations were largely stereotypic
                 across the 71 retinas studied. Our results indicate that
