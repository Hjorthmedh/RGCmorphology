                 hippocampal microcircuits is the quantitative distribution of
                 synaptic inputs of identified cell classes. The complete
                 dendritic trees of functionally distinct interneuron types
                 containing parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D(28k) (CB), or
                 calretinin (CR) were reconstructed at the light microscopic
                 level to describe their geometry, total length, and laminar
                 distribution. Serial electron microscopic reconstruction and
                 postembedding GABA immunostaining was then used to determine
                 the density of GABA-negative asymmetrical (excitatory) and
                 GABA-positive symmetrical (inhibitory) synaptic inputs on
                 their dendrites, somata, and axon initial segments. The total
                 convergence and the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory
                 inputs were then calculated using the light and electron
                 microscopic data sets. The three populations showed
                 characteristic differences in dendritic morphology and in the
                 density and distribution of afferent synapses. PV cells
                 possessed the most extensive dendritic tree (4300 microm) and
                 the thickest dendrites. CR cells had the smallest dendritic
                 tree (2500 microm) and the thinnest shafts. The density of
                 inputs as well as the total number of excitatory plus
                 inhibitory synapses was several times higher on PV cells (on
                 average, 16,294) than on CB (3839) or CR (2186) cells. The
                 ratio of GABAergic inputs was significantly higher on CB
                 (29.4\%) and CR (20.71\%) cells than on PV cells (6.4\%). The
                 density of inhibitory terminals was higher in the perisomatic
                 region than on the distal dendrites. These anatomical data are
                 essential to understand the distinct behavior and role of

                 little is known about L6B neurons on a systematic and
                 quantitative basis. We investigated the morphological and
                 electrophysiological properties of excitatory L6B neurons in
                 the rat somatosensory barrel cortex using whole-cell
                 patch-clamp recordings and simultaneous biocytin fillings.
                 Subsequent histological processing and computer-assisted 3D
                 reconstructions provided the basis for a classification of
                 excitatory L6B neurons according to their structural and
                 functional characteristics. Three distinct clusters of
                 excitatory L6B neurons were identified: (C1) pyramidal neurons
                 with an apical dendrite pointing towards the pial surface,
                 (C2) neurons with a prominent, ``apical''-like dendrite not
                 oriented towards the pia, and (C3) multipolar spiny neurons
                 without any preferential dendritic orientation. The second
                 group could be further subdivided into three categories termed
                 inverted, ``tangentially'' oriented and ``horizontally''
                 oriented neurons. Furthermore, based on the axonal domain two
                 subcategories of L6B pyramidal cells were identified that had
                 either a more barrel-column confined or an extended axonal
                 field. The classification of excitatory L6B neurons provided

                 the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. The type and
                 timing of cellular changes leading to RGC loss in glaucoma
                 remain incompletely understood, including whether specific RGC
                 subtypes are preferentially impacted at early stages of this
                 disease. Here we applied the microbead occlusion model of
                 glaucoma to different transgenic mouse lines, each expressing
                 green fluorescent protein in 1-2 specific RGC subtypes.
                 Targeted filling, reconstruction, and subsequent comparison of
                 the genetically identified RGCs in control and bead-injected
                 eyes revealed that some subtypes undergo significant dendritic
                 rearrangements as early as 7 d following induction of elevated
                 intraocular pressure (IOP). By comparing specific On-type,
                 On-Off-type and Off-type RGCs, we found that RGCs that target
                 the majority of their dendritic arbors to the scleral half or
                 ``Off'' sublamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) undergo
                 the greatest changes, whereas RGCs with the majority of their
                 dendrites in the On sublamina did not alter their structure at
                 this time point. Moreover, M1 intrinsically photosensitive
                 RGCs, which functionally are On RGCs but structurally stratify

                 subtypes manifest significant changes in dendritic structure
                 after very brief exposure to elevated IOP. The observation
                 that RGCs stratifying most of their dendrites in the Off
                 sublamina are first to alter their structure may inform the

                 common measures (such as dendritic radii and the number of
                 dendritic segments) and three new quantifiable measures: 1)
                 the area of influence of the dendritic tree as calculated in
                 an operator-independent manner by using Minkowski sausages; 2)
                 the complexity of tortuousity along each dendritic segment as
                 represented by the 3D bending energy; and 3) the coverage
                 factor as calculated by using the Bouligand-Minkowski fractal
                 dimension, which is more accurate than the commonly used
                 box-counting algorithm. We evaluated four clustering
                 approaches including the k-means and Ward's hierarchical
                 clustering methods. By using these highly quantifiable methods
                 to group the cells into classes, the present work has extended
                 and reassessed the analysis of 68 ganglion cells from the
                 tiger salamander previously classified by Toris et al. ([1995]
                 J. Comp. Neurol. 352:535-559). Though substantiating the
                 number of classes (5) previously proposed by Toris et al., the
                 results obtained here indicate a number of discrepancies among

                 between two classes, originally called the medium simple and
                 the medium complex cells. Such an effect has motivated the
                 proposal of new names for the medium simple and medium complex
                 classes, now called small highly complex and medium cells,
                 respectively. Also included in the present article are
                 comprehensive statistics of each class, correlations among all
                 the adopted shape measures, and examples of the cells from

                 relies on the time-consuming step of arbor tracing. However,
                 as genetic tools and imaging methods make data-driven
                 approaches to neuronal circuit analysis feasible, the need for
                 automated processing increases. Here, we first establish that

  abstract = "Tests for null hypotheses of 'absence of structure' should play
              an important role in any exploratory study, to guard against
              interpretation of sample patterns that could have been obtained
              by chance, and two new tests of this type are described. In the
              multivariate analyses that arise in community ecology and many
              other environmental contexts, e.g. in linking assemblage patterns
              to forcing environmental variables (gradient analysis), the
              problem of chance associations is exacerbated by the large number
              of combinations of abiotic variables that can usually be
              examined. A test which allows for this selection bias is
              described (the global BEST test), which applies to any
              dissimilarity measure, utilises only rank dissimilarities, and
              operates by permutation, assuming no specific distributional form
              or parametric expression for the biotic to abiotic links. A
              second permutation procedure, the similarity profile routine
              (SIMPROF), tests for the presence of sample groups (or more
              continuous sample patterns) in a priori unstructured sets of
              samples, for which an a priori structured test (e.g. the
              widely-used ANOSIM) is invalid. One context is in interpreting
              dendrograms from hierarchical cluster analyses: a series of
              SIMPROF tests provides objective stopping rules for ever-finer
              dissection into subgroups. Connecting these two tests is a third
              methodological strand, adapting De'ath's multivariate equivalent
              of univariate CART analysis (Classification And Regression Trees)
              to a non-parametric context. This produces a divisive,
              constrained, hierarchical cluster analysis of samples, based on
              their assemblage data, termed a linkage tree. The constraint is
              that each binary division of the tree corresponds to a threshold
              on one of the environmental variables and, consistently with
              related non-parametric routines, maximises the high-dimensional
              separation of the two groups, as measured by the ANOSIM R
              statistic. Such linkage trees therefore provide abiotic
              'explanations' for each biotic subdivision of the samples but, as
              with unconstrained clustering, the LINKTREE routine requires
              objective stopping rules to avoid over-interpretation, these
              again being provided by a sequence of SIMPROF tests. The
              inter-connectedness of these three new developments is

              The classifier consists of multiple trees constructed
              systematically by pseudorandomly selecting subsets of components
              of the feature vector, that is, trees constructed in randomly

                 Indeed, visual space is not sampled uniformly across the
                 vertebrate retina. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density
                 increases and dendritic arbor size decreases toward retinal
                 locations with higher sampling frequency, such as the fovea in
                 primates and area centralis in carnivores [1]. In these
                 locations, higher acuity at the level of individual cells is
                 obtained because the receptive field center of a RGC
                 corresponds approximately to the spatial extent of its
                 dendritic arbor [2, 3]. For most species, structurally and
                 functionally distinct RGC types appear to have similar
                 topographies, collectively scaling their cell densities and
                 arbor sizes toward the same retinal location [4]. Thus, visual
                 space is represented across the retina in parallel by multiple
                 distinct circuits [5]. In contrast, we find a population of
                 mouse RGCs, known as alpha or alpha-like [6], that displays a
                 nasal-to-temporal gradient in cell density, size, and
                 receptive fields, which facilitates enhanced visual sampling
                 in frontal visual fields. The distribution of alpha-like RGCs
                 contrasts with other known mouse RGC types and suggests that,

              and transient response-types by the application of a battery of
              simple tests based on responses to standing contrast, fine
              grating patterns, size and speed of contrasting targets, and on
              the presence or absence of the periphery effect. The
              classification is equivalent to the ;X'/;Y' (linear/nonlinear)
              subdivision of Enroth-Cugell \& Robson which is thus confirmed
              and extended.2. The sustained/transient classification applied to
              both on-centre and off-centre cells.3. Lateral geniculate
              neurones may be similarly classified by the same tests.
              Occasional concentrically organized cells had a mixture of
              sustained and transient properties.4. A technique for
              simultaneous recording from a geniculate neurone and one or more
              retinal ganglion cells providing its excitatory input showed that
              the connexions were specific with respect to the
              sustained/transient classification as well as the
              on-centre/off-centre classification. Most geniculate neurones are
              excitatorily driven only by retinal ganglion cells of the same
              functional type. In a few cases the inputs were mixed but only
              with respect to the sustained/transient classification.5.
              Sustained retinal ganglion cells had slower-conducting axons than
              the transient type. The same was true for lateral geniculate
              neurones but in this case the distributions showed considerable
              overlap.6. The sustained/transient classification is the
              functional correlate for the well-known segregation of optic
              nerve fibres into two conduction groups.7. The pathways carrying
              sustained and transient information remain essentially separate

  abstract    = "The mouse retina offers an increasingly valuable model for
                 vision research given the possibilities for genetic
                 manipulation. Here we assess how the structural properties of
                 mouse retinal ganglion cells relate to the stratification
                 pattern of the dendrites of these neurons within the inner
                 plexiform layer. For this purpose, we used 14 morphological
                 measures to classify mouse retinal ganglion cells
                 parametrically into different clusters. Retinal ganglion cells
                 were labeled in one of three ways: Lucifer Yellow injection,
                 'DiOlistics' or transgenic expression of yellow fluorescent
                 protein. The resulting analysis of 182 cells revealed 10
                 clusters of monostratified cells, with dendrites confined to
                 either On or Off sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer, and
                 four clusters of bistratified cells, dendrites spanning the On
                 and Off sublaminae. We also sought to establish how these
                 parametrically identified retinal ganglion cell clusters
                 relate to cell types identified previously on the basis of
                 immunocytochemical staining and the expression of yellow
                 fluorescent protein. Cells labeled with an antibody against
                 melanopsin were found to be located within a single cluster,
                 while those labeled with the SMI-32 antibody were in four
                 different clusters. Yellow fluorescent protein expressing
                 cells were distributed within 13 of the 14 clusters identified
                 here, which demonstrates that yellow fluorescent protein
                 expression is a useful method for labeling virtually the
                 entire population of mouse retinal ganglion cells.
                 Collectively, these findings provide a valuable baseline for
                 future studies dealing with the effects of genetic mutations

  abstract    = "How specific features in the environment are represented
                 within the brain is an important unanswered question in
                 neuroscience. A subset of retinal neurons, called
                 direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), are specialized
                 for detecting motion along specific axes of the visual field.
                 Despite extensive study of the retinal circuitry that endows
                 DSGCs with their unique tuning properties, their downstream
                 circuitry in the brain and thus their contribution to visual
                 processing has remained unclear. In mice, several different
                 types of DSGCs connect to the dorsal lateral geniculate
                 nucleus (dLGN), the visual thalamic structure that harbours
                 cortical relay neurons. Whether direction-selective
                 information computed at the level of the retina is routed to
                 cortical circuits and integrated with other visual channels,
                 however, is unknown. Here we show that there is a di-synaptic
                 circuit linking DSGCs with the superficial layers of the
                 primary visual cortex (V1) by using viral trans-synaptic
                 circuit mapping and functional imaging of visually driven
                 calcium signals in thalamocortical axons. This circuit pools
                 information from several types of DSGCs, converges in a
                 specialized subdivision of the dLGN, and delivers
                 direction-tuned and orientation-tuned signals to superficial
                 V1. Notably, this circuit is anatomically segregated from the
                 retino-geniculo-cortical pathway carrying non-direction-tuned
                 visual information to deeper layers of V1, such as layer 4.
                 Thus, the mouse harbours several functionally specialized,
                 parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways, one of which
                 originates with retinal DSGCs and delivers direction- and
                 orientation-tuned information specifically to the superficial
                 layers of the primary visual cortex. These data provide
                 evidence that direction and orientation selectivity of some V1
                 neurons may be influenced by the activation of DSGCs.",

                 adult cat retina, the alpha and beta cells are the most well
                 documented, thus providing a basis of comparison for
                 developing ganglion cells. Alpha and beta ganglion cells in
                 cat retinae at various ages from birth (P0) to adult were
                 intracellularly injected with Lucifer yellow. At all ages,
                 both cell types strongly resembled their adult counterparts.
                 However, transient developmental characteristics established
                 their immaturity. These features included spiny protuberances
                 and ``rings'' along the dendritic surface that were no longer
                 detectable after 3 weeks of age. In a small proportion of both
                 inner and outer stratifying alpha ganglion cells, there was
                 aberrant dendritic arborization. However, by P5 there was no
                 remaining evidence of this deviant stratification pattern and
                 all alpha and beta cells displayed the adult pattern of
                 unistratification (present among the majority of these cells
                 from birth). For both alpha and beta cells, the area of
                 greatest development was the retinal periphery. In this region
                 alpha cell dendritic trees continued to grow until 3 weeks
                 postnatally, when they approached the adult dendritic field
                 size; around this time, the major period of beta cell
                 dendritic expansion began. From birth to adulthood, the
                 distance between alpha cell dendritic branching points
                 increased, while the number of nodes and tips decreased with
                 age. The temporal disparity between alpha and beta cell
                 dendritic expansion suggests that postnatal dendritic
                 development involves an active process of growth, rather than
                 merely passive stretching.",

                 transgenic mouse line, Hoxd10-GFP, in which the RGCs

                 group of vertebrates, the agnathans or jawless fishes. The
                 single species of the southern hemisphere lamprey family
                 Geotriidae, Geotria australis, possesses the potential for
                 pentachromatic color discrimination opposed to the mono- or
                 dichromacy found in other lampreys. However, little is known
                 of the retinal ganglion cell types that contribute to visual
                 processing in G. australis. A quantitative morphological
                 approach was used to distinguish and describe retinal ganglion
                 cell types in G. australis. The morphology of retinal ganglion
                 cells was revealed by retrograde biocytin labeling from the
                 optic disc. Cells were digitally reconstructed, and somatic
                 area and position and dendritic field size, density,
                 tortuosity, and stratification were subjected to quantitative
                 morphometric analyses. Cluster analysis, in conjunction with
                 similarity profile analysis (SIMPROF), statistically
                 identified five discrete monostratified retinal ganglion cell
                 types, one of which may comprise two subtypes. Two
                 bistratified types were identified separately, including a
                 biplexiform and a bistratified subtype. The use of cluster
                 analysis with SIMPROF provided a robust statistical technique
                 for objectively identifying cell types whose characteristics
                 were similar and significantly different from those of other
                 types and thus provides an objective resolution of the
                 problems posed by ``lumpers vs. splitters'' when designating
                 cell types. The diversity of retinal ganglion cells suggests
                 that visual information in the lamprey G. australis is
                 processed in parallel streams, as in gnathostomes. These
                 findings, together with the results of previous studies,
                 indicate that the visual system of the lamprey G. australis
                 represents the upper limit of visual complexity in extant
                 agnathans.",

                 remains poorly understood. Here, we explore the cellular
                 mechanisms of axon target matching in the developing visual
                 system by comparing four transgenic mouse lines, each with a
                 different population of genetically labeled retinal ganglion
                 cells (RGCs) that connect to unique combinations of brain
                 targets. We find that the time when an RGC axon arrives in the
                 brain is correlated with its target selection strategy.
                 Early-born, early-arriving RGC axons initially innervate
                 multiple targets. Subsequently, most of those connections are
                 removed. By contrast, later-born, later-arriving RGC axons are
                 highly accurate in their initial target choices. These data
                 reveal the diversity of cellular mechanisms that mammalian CNS
                 axons use to pick their targets and highlight the key role of
                 birthdate and outgrowth timing in influencing this precision.

                 moving in the opposite, ``null,'' direction. Historically,

                 tuning of TRHR-DSGCs is broader than that of DRD4-DSGCs.
                 Second, whereas both populations project similarly to the
                 dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, they project differently to
                 the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior

  abstract    = "It is now clear that electrical coupling via gap junctions is
                 prevalent across the retina, expressed by each of the five
                 main neuronal types. With the introduction of mutants in which
                 selective gap junction connexins are deleted, the mouse has
                 recently become an important model for studying the function
                 of coupling between retinal neurons. In this study we examined
                 the tracer-coupling pattern of ganglion cells by injecting
                 them with the gap junction-permanent tracer Neurobiotin to
                 provide, for the first time, a comprehensive survey of
                 ganglion cell coupling in the wildtype mouse retina. Murine
                 ganglion cells were differentiated into 22 morphologically
                 distinct subtypes based on soma-dendritic parameters. Most
                 (16/22) ganglion cell subtypes were tracer-coupled to
                 neighboring ganglion and/or amacrine cells. The amacrine cells
                 coupled to ganglion cells displayed either polyaxonal or
                 wide-field morphologies with extensive arbors. We found that
                 different subtypes of ganglion cells were never coupled to one
                 another, indicating that they subserved independent electrical
                 networks. Finally, we found that the tracer-coupling patterns
                 of the 22 ganglion cell populations were largely stereotypic
                 across the 71 retinas studied. Our results indicate that
                 electrical coupling is extensive in the inner retina of the
                 mouse, suggesting 0",
