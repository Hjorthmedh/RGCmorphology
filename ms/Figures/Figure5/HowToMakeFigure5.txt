All the figures assume that you have the cache file already, if you do not already have it run (the data directory to choose is DATA/RanaEldanaf/XML):

r = RGCclass();
r.lazySave();

If you want to use default location (and skip the dialogue), use r = RGCclass(-1);


To generate figures (need to run them in this order):

makeConfidenceFigure.m
makeFeatureSpaceFigure.m
