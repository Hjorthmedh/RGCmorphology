All the figures assume that you have the cache file already, if you do not already have it run (the data directory to choose is DATA/RanaEldanaf/XML):

r = RGCclass();
r.lazySave();

If you want to use default location (and skip the dialogue), use r = RGCclass(-1);



Figure 6 is generated in a two step fashion, run the two commands:

findBestHoxd10Split
plotHoxdSplit

Then combine the two using illustrator.
